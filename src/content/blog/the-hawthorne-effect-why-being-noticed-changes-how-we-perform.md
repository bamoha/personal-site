One time, during a course I was taking, the instructor mentioned an old experiment where factory workers became more productive simply because someone was watching them. The idea that awareness could change behavior sounded interesting to me.

That was my first encounter with what's known as the Hawthorne Effect.

## The original experiment

It began in the late 1920s at a factory called Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois. Researchers wanted to see how lighting and working conditions affected productivity. They brightened the lights, then dimmed them. They changed schedules and added rest breaks. Strangely, productivity kept rising no matter what they did.

Eventually, they realized it was not about the conditions. The workers knew they were being studied, and that awareness influenced them to be more productive.

## Seeing it in everyday life

After that course, I started seeing the same thing happen in my own routine. When people showed interest in what I was working on, I focused more. Even writing this piece feels different knowing someone else might read it later.

It is the same feeling behind why people stay more consistent with fitness goals when others are involved in their progress. When friends or family can follow your steps or workouts, you naturally try a little harder. We act differently when we know someone is watching, even if the audience is invisible.

And it is not limited to productivity. A study on hand-washing among medical staff found that when healthcare workers knew they were being observed, compliance was 55 percent higher than when they thought no one was watching (Eckmanns, 2006). Observation alone shaped behavior in a measurable way.

## The limits of observation

The Hawthorne Effect reveals something subtle about human nature. People might perform better when they feel noticed. A little attention can create momentum. Recognition becomes motivation. But the effect does not always last. Once attention fades, performance often returns to normal.

The original Hawthorne studies were far from perfect. Later reviews found missing data, weak documentation, and inconsistent results. Some improvements may have come from better supervision or group morale rather than observation itself. In some cases, the boost disappeared once the novelty wore off.

## Why it still matters

Still, the idea continues to resonate. It reminds us that attention has power, even if that power is temporary. Sometimes, simply knowing that what we do is being noticed can change how we show up, even in small ways.

The workers at Hawthorne did not necessarily perform better because the lights were brighter. They performed differently because someone paid attention.

And in a workplace, that lesson still matters. People need to feel that their efforts are seen and valued. Recognition builds connection, and connection sustains motivation long after observation fades. When people feel noticed for the right reasons, they work harder and care more deeply about the work itself.
