# Giving Your AI Eyes: Bringing the Power of Chrome DevTools to Your Coding Assistant using MCP

I gave this talk at **DevFest Abeokuta**, where I explored how we can move beyond text-only coding assistants by giving them real visibility into what is happening in the browser.

The session focused on using **Chrome DevTools** together with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to allow an AI assistant reason about actual UI state, DOM structure, network activity, and runtime behaviour, instead of relying purely on assumptions from code.

I walked through practical examples showing how this approach can help with debugging, performance analysis, and UI problem-solving, especially in frontend-heavy applications. The emphasis was on real developer workflows and how this kind of setup can make AI assistants genuinely more useful in day-to-day work.

The goal of the talk was to show what becomes possible when AI tools are given proper context, and how developers can start experimenting with this today using tools they already know.
