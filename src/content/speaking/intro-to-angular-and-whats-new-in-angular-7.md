# Intro to Angular and What's New in Angular 7

I gave this talk as an introduction to **Angular**, aimed at developers who were either new to the framework or looking to better understand how it fits into modern frontend development.

The first part of the session focused on Angular fundamentals: how Angular is structured, the problems it is designed to solve, and how concepts like components, modules, and dependency injection work together. The goal was to make Angular feel less intimidating and more approachable, especially for developers coming from other JavaScript frameworks.

In the second part, I walked through what was new in **Angular 7** at the time. This included performance improvements, better tooling support, updates to the Angular CLI, and changes that made applications faster and easier to maintain. I also shared practical advice on when and how to upgrade existing projects.

Overall, the session was meant to give developers a solid starting point with Angular, while also helping existing Angular users understand what had changed and why those changes mattered.
