          I have always enjoyed speaking to people.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was in university, I served in the computer students association executive role as General Secretary, a position that required me to constantly communicate with students, organise meetings, and run campaigns. That experience pushed me into the middle of conversations and public-facing roles, and I quickly realised that I enjoyed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, public speaking became something I leaned into rather than avoided. As a student, I went on to organise, host, and speak at several events. Standing in front of people, explaining ideas, and facilitating discussions started to feel natural to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, this interest grew beyond the university environment. I have continued to speak at tech events, share what I am learning, and engage with developer communities. For me, public speaking is not about performing on stage, but about connecting with people and exchanging ideas in a clear and honest way.
        <p>
          Interested in having me speak at your event?
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always open to new opportunities. If you think I might be a good fit for your event, feel free to <a href={`mailto:${SITE.EMAIL}`} class="text-black dark:text-[#d1d5db] underline">reach out</a> with the details and we can take it from there.
