          I never planned to become a speaker. It started with a title I did not ask for.
        </p>
        <p>
          In university, I became General Secretary of the computer students association. Suddenly, I was the person who had to stand up, explain things, rally people, and make announcements nobody wanted to hear. It was uncomfortable at first. But somewhere between organizing meetings and running campaigns, I realized I actually liked it. The nerves never fully disappeared, but the pull to communicate became stronger than the fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          That curiosity turned into intention. I started hosting events, facilitating discussions, and eventually stepping onto stages to share ideas of my own. What began as a responsibility became something I genuinely looked forward to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I speak at tech events and developer meetups across communities like DevFest Abuja and Abeokuta. I talk about frontend engineering, software craftsmanship, and the quiet lessons I have picked up along the way. For me, speaking is not performance. It is thinking out loud with people who care about the same things I do.
        </p>
        <p class="font-semibold text-black dark:text-[#d1d5db]">
          Want me at your event?
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always open to new stages and new conversations. If you think I would be a good fit, <a href={`mailto:${SITE.EMAIL}`} class="text-black dark:text-[#d1d5db] underline hover:opacity-75 transition-opacity">send me a message</a> and let us talk.
